 KNN Handwritten Digit Classification
An interactive web-based implementation of the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm for handwritten digit classification, built entirely with vanilla HTML, CSS and JavaScript.
📋 Project Overview
This project demonstrates the KNN machine learning algorithm on a simulated handwritten digits dataset (similar to sklearn's load_digits()). The application provides a comprehensive visualization of the classification process, including accuracy metrics, confusion matrices, and real-time predictions.
✨ Features

Interactive Dataset Visualization: View sample digit images from the training set
Flexible K Selection: Train models with different K values (3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, 15)
Real-time Training: Train individual K values or batch train all at once
Performance Metrics: Track accuracy, best K value, and training time
Accuracy vs K Graph: Visual representation of how accuracy changes with K
Confusion Matrix: Detailed 10x10 matrix showing classification results
Prediction Display: View 15 random test samples with predictions
Feature Scaling: Implements StandardScaler for normalized features
Educational Content: Built-in interview Q&A section

🚀 How to Use

Open the Application: Open index.html in any modern web browser
View Dataset: Sample digit images are automatically displayed
Select K Value: Choose a K value from the dropdown (default: 3)
Train Model: Click "Train Model" to train with selected K
Compare K Values: Click "Train All K Values" to test multiple K values
Analyze Results: View accuracy chart, confusion matrix, and predictions
Reset: Click "Reset" to clear all results and start over
